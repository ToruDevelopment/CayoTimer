## What is CayoTimer ?

CayoTimer is a tool designed to help you with the Cayo Perico Heist in GTA Online by automatically disconnecting your internet at the perfect timing for the glitch. This timer operates without injecting any code into the game, making it completely invisible and undetectable to the game. It is not considered a cheat and works seamlessly in the background.

### Features

- **Automatic Click**: Precisely times the click for the Cayo Perico Heist glitch.
- **Invisible**: Works without injecting anything into the game, making it undetectable.
- **Ready to Use**: No setup or installation required.

### Usage Instructions

1. Download CayoTimer from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ToruDevelopment/CayoTimer/releases) page.
2. Watch the [Video Showcase and Guide](https://youtu.be/_e13KX1yv6U) for detailed instructions on how to use the tool.
3. The program will automatically click at the right moment for the glitch, ensuring the internet is disconnected at the precise timing.

### How It Works

CayoTimer itself does not disconnect the internet. Instead, it automatically clicks the left mouse button at the specified timing. Users must position their cursor over the internet toggle switch beforehand, as shown in the instructional video. The program will then execute the click to disconnect the internet at the correct moment.
